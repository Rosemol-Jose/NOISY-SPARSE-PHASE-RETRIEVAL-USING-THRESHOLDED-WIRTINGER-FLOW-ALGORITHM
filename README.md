# NOISY-SPARSE-PHASE-RETRIEVAL-USING-THRESHOLDED-WIRTINGER-FLOW-ALGORITHM
 #Implementing and evaluating the TWF algorithm against real datasets.
 
 #The project is trying to find a solution for phase loss of a signal during various signal processing applications using modified Wirtinger Flow Algorithm.

 #Project plots the effects of different factors on the error in observations.
 
 #The detailed view of problem is found in the thesis report i  the repository.
 
 #We tried  to implement the algorithm for a larger dataset which is in progress.
 
#Dataset  available at           : See http://dsp.rice.edu/research/transmissionmatrices/
